Django JSON Serializer

This is a django serializer that outputs sensible json to be sent to the
frontend, rather than intended as a serializer to a file.

<insert working example here>
(Ok, I haven't actually finished the fork yet ;-)

This project was originally forked from but has been changed extensively:
https://code.google.com/p/wadofstuff/wiki/DjangoFullSerializers

The original code produced a json format that was good for ./manage.py dump and
load, but wasn't as suitable for sending data to a web client for processing
via ajax.
